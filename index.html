        <h1>Hello! My name is Mysha, Today I am Going To Tell About My Hobby Which Is Art! </h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Art is My Favorite hobby because I can paint or draw my feeling and I can draw or express myself. Also I can draw or paint anything of my choice. I learn many things from Art.
            Art is something that stimulates an individual's thoughts, emotions, beliefs, or ideas through the senses.Art is generally understood as any activity or product done by people with a communicative or aesthetic purpose something that expresses an idea, an emotion or, more generally, a world view. It is a component of culture, reflecting economic and social substrates in its design. </p>
